# Huffman Coding Algorithm

## Overview
This project implements the Huffman coding algorithm for lossless data compression. Huffman coding is widely used in data compression algorithms such as ZIP compression. It works by assigning variable-length codes to input characters, with shorter codes assigned to more frequent characters, resulting in efficient compression.

## Approach

### Using Trees
In the tree-based approach, a binary min-heap is used to construct the Huffman tree. Initially, each character and its frequency are stored in separate nodes of the min-heap. Then, the two nodes with the lowest frequencies are combined to create a new node whose frequency is the sum of the frequencies of the two nodes. This process is repeated until only one node remains in the min-heap, which becomes the root of the Huffman tree. Huffman codes are generated by traversing the Huffman tree, with left branches representing binary 0 and right branches representing binary 1.

### Using Linked Lists
In the linked list-based approach, a sorted linked list is used to construct the Huffman tree. Initially, each character and its frequency are stored in separate nodes of the linked list, which is maintained in sorted order based on node frequencies. Nodes with the lowest frequencies are repeatedly combined to create new nodes until only one node remains, which becomes the root of the Huffman tree. Huffman codes are generated by traversing the Huffman tree, with left branches representing binary 0 and right branches representing binary 1.

## Features
- Huffman tree construction using a binary min-heap and linked list or an array (see the commits)
- Generation of Huffman codes for each input character
- Encoding of input text using the generated Huffman codes
- Writing of encoded text to a file
- Calculation of compression ratio achieved

## Usage
1. **Compilation**: Compile the source code using a C++ compiler.
2. **Execution**: Run the compiled executable, providing the input text to be compressed.
3. **Output**: The program outputs the initial size of the input text, the size of the encoded text, and the compression ratio achieved.

## Example
Suppose we have the input text "ABRACADABRA". After compression, the initial size of the text is 11 bytes. The encoded text size is 6 bits. The compression ratio achieved is (11 * 8) / 6 = 14.67x.

- `main.cpp`: Implementation of Huffman coding using an array-based/linked-based min-heap.
- The latest change of the main file contains the version of huffman using a Linked list but the previous commits contains the version with the arra-based Huffman compression code
